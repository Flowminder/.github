At Flowminder, we work with pseudonymised mobile operator data, satellite and household survey data to support data-driven decision-making for development and humanitarian purposes in low- and middle-income countries.

We develop methods, tools, engineering solutions, and data processing models to safely and securely process data to generate accurate and easy-to-use estimates and indicators of human mobility and population distribution across low- and middle-income countries.
